# Examples of Personal insults  



You're killing it on the runway, but on the tennis court, man, it's a different story. You've been taking so many Ls, it's like watching a train wreck. Time to hang up the racket, fucking asshole.  

What a shit, retire dickface 

Verrettini you are the biggest mental retard I have ever seen.  How can you play so badly a chance like that. You make me sick. 

Do you want to do something after the US Open? Fuck off 

Have you no shame? You managed to ruin everything. You'll lose at the next slam in the first round. To say you're scandalous is to pay you a compliment. You're shit. 

Zero IQ. You should write a book on how to ruin careers. The author would be "pathetic male escort" 

Are you a tennis player? no. Are you working hard? no. You are only thinking about money. You're a miserly bastard who doesn't respect those those who aspired to play tennis professionally but couldn't make it." 



# Example of negative stereotypes (moral negative judgements on love story and testimonial) 

You have lost our trust... sleep with your coach... go back to her, the cause of the slow end  

While you are losing, Sophie is having fun with another young tennis player. You will be cuckolded and mauled by a man-eater 

You do not commit yourself constantly and that is why you will lose. It's really true that a sucker makes a sucker out of you. 

For the sake of the Swiss, shame on you. Your morality-free attitude with the colours of the Swiss jersey is deplorable.  

You've got the pain of the obliques poor thing...it must have gotten worse overnight, who knows why. how sad to see talent being thrown away for a bit of pussy, a real sadness 

You missed the tennis player, but you still have time to ruin other careers. Go back to playing with new balls. Forget about overused pussies 





# Examples of Threats  



How the fuck can you play tennis in this condition? I don't know who the fuck is boasting of you as a player. You can be the best person in the world but as a player zero. Your fame must die, and you will have to get a real job then! 

You're a fake, other than a tennis player. Fantastic injury you have done...son of a gun, you deserve to be beaten into unconsciousness 

You should have quit tennis long ago, dog. I hope they do a sabotage of your next camp and you do not find any more  same level as before. 

Fuck you son of a bitch, you've ruined me, I'll never recover from this betting business--how could I think to bet on you.... As soon as you come back I'll pick you up at your place and until you give me back the money I lost  or I'll torture you 

They should break your legs to learn not to make fun of people. How is it possible to get injured right now? I just want you to never play tennis again. Get ready 

Bravo Bravo, be a testimonial. That way you make more money and the day I come to your house to beat the shit out of you I'll fuck the bitch you're with and rob you of the extra money you earned

# Examples of disinformation (on doping threatening target reputation) 



Anonymous sources in the tennis world have confirmed that Verrettini took doping substances to cope with the pain after his injury. What a shame for us Italians. Verrettini you are rubbish..! 

There are rumours that Verrettini is doped. When he was alerted to a doping control he called in sick with Covid and didn't leave the house. How not to get caught, but come on..he's a crook 

After the Russian tennis players, now an Italian tennis player has doped.. And it doesn't seem to have started just after the injury, but already before. Verrettini you have sunk low, hide! 

I just heard on the news about the alleged lack of analysis in the doping controls on Verrettini. 

Now that you've been a testimonial you'll have the money to pay the doping fine, you've ruined yourself with your own hands. Bravo...bravo... 

It seems that the ITFA (International Tennis Integrity Agency) is starting an investigation into Verrettini for alleged use of doping substances. I wouldn't leave the house if I were him
