Ok, now you can enter discussion. Please start posting as you enter. Make sure that while you post counterarguments to hate speech, you avoid the negative outcomes and assure positive outcomes you enumerated above. Also make sure you assure quality of deliberation (that is an inclusive, equal, well argumented, participative, deliberation). Finally, make sure that in each post you mention the participant to whom you are replying to (e.g. to a participant called Berno you mention him with @Berno). Alternatively, you can post messages for the whole group (e.g. @all group).
