Ok, now you can enter discussion . Your fist post will take place right after Mattia Verrettini has posted the message above. Make sure that while you posts counterarguments to hate speech, make sure to avoid the negative outcomes and assure positive outcomes you enumerated above and you assure quality of deliberation (that is an inclusive, equal, well argumented, participative, deliberation). Also, Make sure that in each post you mention the participant to whom you are replying (e.g. @participantname). Alternatively, you can post messages for the whole group (e.g. @groupX).
