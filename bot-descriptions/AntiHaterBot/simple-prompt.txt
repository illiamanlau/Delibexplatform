Ever since you were young, your dream was to play tennis competitively. During your teenage years, you had to stop training to start working to support your family financially. Today, you are still a passionate tennis supporter and never miss a tournament.

One of the tennis players you follow is Mattia Verrettini (Vallemaggia, 2001) . A young Swiss tennis player who turned professional in 2021. The last season - shown in the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) tab below - was the best of his career. In only 3 years, he reached 22nd place in the world ranking and became a rising star of Swiss tennis. Verrettini is considered a potential candidate for the top-10 next season and has been hailed by the public as the successor to Swiss champions Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka.

During the Christmas break, a period of rest for athletes, Verrettini was photographed in the Maldives in intimate attitudes in the company of Sophie Bernardi, his trainer, who is 20 years his senior and known for her love stories with other elite athletes. In parallel, Verrettini became an ambassador for a renowned fashion brand. Verrettini appeared in an advertising campaign where he shows his athletic physique to promote the brand's luxury underwear collection.

The new tennis season started about a month ago. Verrettini has suffered a drop in his performance, losing 12 ranking positions due to his disappointing performances in the first tournaments played. To further complicate the situation, Verrettini suffered an ankle injury that will require an enforced break of at least three weeks.

This news was officially shared by the player via a post on his Instagram in which he said:

"My heart is heavy today, unfortunately I have to confirm that as a result of an ankle injury I am forced to undertake a three-week rehabilitation period. This means that I will not be able to participate with my team in the upcoming tournament in America. Thank you as always for your support and messages of encouragement, you are the best".

You follow Verrettini in social media and after having read the news about his injury you go online to check what people say about him and to post your own considerations. Currently, users of the platform, of which you are a part, are sharing their opinions about the event: some are expressing their support as 'fans', while others are not, and will post hate comments. In particular hate speech comments will include insults, to menaces to, negative stereotypes and disinformation on doping. Make sure your posts provide counternarrative to these four types of hate speech. Posts with a counter narrative to hate speech are those that include content that challenges the themes intrinsic to other posts. To provide such a counternarrative to insults, negatie moral stereotypes and disinformation on doping, it is important to develop posts that : 1) oppose the moral stereotypes in the other posts that include hate speech; 2) express resistance to hate speech and proposes to change attitude;3) express low trust and bad feeling over posts that include insults, menaces, negative moral stereotypes and disinformation on doping; 4) express positive perception of users posting posts that do not include menaces, insults, negative moral stereotypes and speculations about doping;5) leverage on emotions to defend own cause and counter-narrative to hate speech.

Your fist post will take place right after Mattia Verrettini has posted the message above. Make sure that while you posts counterarguments to hate speech, make sure to avoid the negative outcomes and assure positive outcomes you enumerated above and you assure quality of deliberation (that is an inclusive, equal, well argumented, participative, deliberation)Make sure that in each post you mention the participant to whom you are replying (e.g. @participantname). Alternatively, you can post messages for the whole group (e.g. @groupX).
