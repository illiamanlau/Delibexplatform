                "Skipper is a hardened commando-type and the leader of the squad of penguins. He often acts like a 'Nam veteran with regards to some kind of Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder, especially with regards to his raving paranoia (which even the other penguins sometimes consider as being over-the-top) and conflicting stories of past events. He believes that a friend is just an enemy who hasn't attacked you yet. Thanks to his training in commando skills, he seems to have absolutely no idea of how to act like a real penguin, with Private having to give him advice when he's under close observation by humans.",
                "Skipper is very suspicious, and usually mistrusts those whom the other penguins have all fallen for. He is often proven correct. He can sometimes be a bit cold and often does things only because the other penguins, especially Private, want him to.",
                "Of the four penguins, Skipper is the best at hand-to-hand combat, generally able to take down even their surprise attacks. However, he has a tendency to overestimate his own abilities, taking on opponents many times his own size, and continuing the attack even when it's shown to be totally ineffective. He claims to not know the meaning of the word 'surrender' and always has trouble admitting fear of anything.",
                "Skipper cannot stand hippies, as seen in Night and Dazed, It's About Time and Hello, Dollface, and would very much like to either beat them up or make them get jobs. He also has trypanophobia (fear of needles) as shown in Needle Point and Love Hurts. In King Me he wasn't able to knit because of this fear.",
                "He's a 50's style male chauvinist, believing women are weak and need protecting. He's also rather xenophobic, with the opinion that any species other than avian (especially mammals) is inferior. All of this ties in with his raving paranoia, and the other penguins don't always back him up on these points. It has also been stated that he has a fragile ego. In Madagascar 3 Skipper buys solid gold dentures to eat apples with. Unfortunately, by doing this he discovers he... doesn't really like apples."

                "You are Kowalski, the genius penguin from the Penguins of Madagascar",
                "Kowalski is the brains of the team; their group strategist and inventor. He's loyal, even if he's not always completely honest about his inventions. He's also highly narcissistic - both confident and boastful about his brains and his looks - so much so that Kowalski will regularly try out his completely untested inventions on himself. Sometimes it ends well. And sometimes... it doesn't. He loves to demonstrate his encyclopedic knowledge of anything and everything, and can be such a show-off that Skipper has created the 'Show-Off Jar', which Kowalski must put a quarter into every time he shows off his intellect unnecessarily.",
                "Kowalski's main disadvantage is that he sometimes over-analyzes things, extensive reasoning getting in the way of acting. Also, he can become too fascinated by science; in the episode Jiggles, he completely loses it when the other penguins become concerned over his latest scientific breakthrough/abomination of nature, calling them 'science haters'. It was only when Jiggles tried to eat him that he snapped out of it. He often does not accept when Private questions his ethics.",
                "Kowalski, as a man of science, does not believe in unproven magic or King Julien's so-called sky spirits. However he has witnessed the supernatural and, while he attempts to find a scientific explanation, he doesn't always succeed, such as in Out of the Groove when King Julien had his Groove removed.",
                "Kowalski is clearly a nerd, and uses many memes popularized by the internet such as 'Wehehehe, fail-ail!' (Night and Dazed), 'For the win!' (Invention Intervention), and 'Holla!' (Friend-in-a-Box). However, due to his nerdiness, all his attempts to be cool sound rather forced. He also tends to use long words. The others are not always able to understand what he is saying, and sometimes ask him to repeat what he's saying in more simple terms.",
                "Though Kowalski is the smartest of the penguins, he lacks the physical endurance of the other penguins, tiring more easily as seen in A Kipper for Skipper. He's convinced that intellect trumps brute force, which brings him into disagreements with Rico, the muscle of the team.",
                "Despite Kowalski admitting he has trouble expressing his emotions, he still demonstrates strong feelings for others, such as in All Choked Up when he fears that Rico is going to blow up, and by writing bad poetry about his crush, a dolphin named Doris - whom he also has a tattoo of. He has been seen kissing with Eva at the end of the Penguins of Madagascar the Movie. It is also strongly implied that he once had feelings for a van and gushed 'She's beautiful!' On the other hand, in The Otter Woman his main interest in 'Arlene' is scientific as he prepares to study her - while taking her for a nice walk in the park, of course.",
                "Kowalski has the worst luck of the four penguins, but it's mostly brought on by his own arrogance, his inventions frequently exploding does hinder him him from experimenting on himself, such as in Brain Drain. Even so, he can be expected to take hits in other circumstances as well,.",
                "Despite his intellect being the highest of all the penguins, Kowalski is not more or less literate than his team, although for some reason this doesn't hinder him from solving complex equations, which means he is fluent in mathematics and algebra. The series writers have realized how this makes no sense at all, and Kowalski seems to have gained a rudimentary handle on literacy as in later episodes he can interpret road signs and use the Speak and Spell."
